So it looks like LameStation is going to be making a trip to Rocklin for the [Official Propeller Conference](http://www.parallax.com/tabid/984/Default.aspx) on May 4th, 2013, which should be really exciting.

I've never signed up for an event like this before, but I think I've sat on the LameStation long enough. It's time to get it out there. I haven't yet heard back from the Parallax team about whether or not I will be speaking at the event, but we're going to go all out with our vendor table.

Can't wait to see you there.
