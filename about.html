          <h3>It all started at school...</h3>
          <p>The LameStation is a game console designed from the ground up with learning in mind. It had to be, since it started as a school project.</p>
          <p>That's right! Brett designed the first prototype by himself while he was still a student at UC Irvine, and that's why it looks the way it does today:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Brett wasn't good at soldering</strong>, so the LameStation uses all through-hole components, large solder pads, and can be tested at multiple points during assembly.</li>
            <li><strong>Brett had to finish someday</strong>, so a complicated multi-chip system with nine million features was not going to work. The LameStation is a system complicated enough to make it work, but nothing more.</li>
            <li><strong>Brett wanted to learn something</strong>, so using off-the-shelf, working pieces to build it would have defeated the whole purpose. Every piece had to be created from scratch and had to be easy to understand.</li>
          </ul>
