              <h2>A history of lame</h2>
              <p>The LameStation is a game console designed from the ground up with learning in mind. It had to be, since it started as a school project.</p>
              <p>That's right! The LameStation is five years in the making, and Brett designed the first prototype by himself while he was still a student at UC Irvine.</p>
              <p>That's a big part of why it looks the way it does today:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Brett wasn't good at soldering</strong>, so the LameStation uses all through-hole components, large solder pads, and can be tested at multiple points during assembly.</li>
                <li><strong>Brett had to finish someday</strong>, so a complicated multi-chip system with nine million features was not going to work. The LameStation is a system complicated enough to make it work, but nothing more.</li>
                <li><strong>Brett wanted to learn something</strong>, so using off-the-shelf, working pieces to build it would have defeated the whole purpose. Every piece had to be created from scratch and had to be easy to understand.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>So why is it lame?</h2>
              <p><em>Because it's the best that 1989 had to offer!</em></p>
              <p>But really, it's all the things it doesn't offer that makes it special.</p>

                  <h4>...have much memory</h4>
                  <p>With 32kB of memory, the entire platform, every line of code that goes into your game, can be read through in a day (though you may not understand all of it!)</p>

                <div class="col-sm-4 col-md-4">
                  <h4>...support color</h4>
                  <p>Color makes everything bigger: more memory, more code, more speed. The LameStation's tiny, black and white screen is easy to understand and even easier to write a driver for.</p>
