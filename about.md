Sure, you've played it before: game boy, game gear,  DS, PSP and how many others? What now? What do you do next?  Have you ever wanted to go further? Have you ever wanted to learn everything there is to know about these devices? How they're made? How they work? How they go from a brick on a table to hours and hours of interactive fun?

Well now you can, with the LameStation. The LameStation is a gaming handheld designed for someone who wants to do more than just play. The LameStation is for someone who wants to do,  to create. Someone with insatiable curiosity who wants to know everything about the world around you. If that sounds like you, this product is for you.

The LameStation is simple, straightforward, designed using simple circuits that could be found in any Intro to EE textbook, and using a programming language,  Spin, that is easy yet powerful.
