    <h1>Brett Weir</h1>
    <p class="lead">Founder and CEO</p>
    <p>Brett originally developed the LameStation as his senior design project at UC Irvine, where he studied Electrical Engineering.</p>
    <p>Brett believes that the key to success is passion and genuine excitement about whatever you do. That's why he quit his job as a software engineer to start LameStation LLC, where he hopes to bring the joy of building your own game console to as many people as he can.</p>
    <p>When Brett isn't developing game consoles, you can probably find him writing music. He is a published songwriter and has been songwriting since middle school.</p>
